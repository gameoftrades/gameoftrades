<h1>Online Service by Software Improvement Group (SIG.eu) to Evaluate Code Quality</h1>

De Haagse Hogeschool, Faculteit IT & Design.

When: September 2018


## Why evaluate your code? 

Spend less time fixing bugs. And more time shipping new features.

It is amazing to see how far our industry has come over the past decades. New technologies, frameworks, agile processes - some of which were only recently invented - now define the way we work today. One prominently missing building block in the modern development setup is a standardised way to normatively measure code quality - a SMART 'Definition of Done' shared by all developers.

Based on 15+ years of research and tens of thousands of measurements on IT systems from numerous industries, SIG presents 'Better Code Hub’ (BCH), an online environment that allows anyone to measure how their code compares to 10 rules for future-proof code. These ten rules code are described in SIG's book 'Building Maintainable Software', which was published with O'Reilly Media or can be downloaded [here C# edition in pdf](https://www.sig.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Building_Maintainable_Software_C_Sharp_SIG.pdf).

A clean codebase keeps development velocity high and makes it easy for developers to start contributing. Better Code Hub indicates just the right amount of refactoring needed to keep it compliant.
Better Code Hub checks your code for compliance against 10 benchmarked software engineering guidelines. It gives immediate feedback on where to focus for quality improvements. 16 modern programming languages are supported.

## Evaluating your code by using Better Code Hub (BCH).

1. Your code will be automatically evaluated and benchmarked against 10 guidelines for building future-proof code. Find a concise reference card of the guidelines [here](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*TS-ZTeI7sQS7dy_AlMqSXQ.png)

2. You can check your code against the guidelines using [Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com), a GitHub integration provided by [Software Improvement Group SIG](https://www.sig.eu/better-code-hub/). Better Code Hub integrates with the GitHub Flow and can easily run in your CI/CD pipeline on all your Pull Requests and commits.

3. 16 modern programming languages are [supported](https://bettercodehub.com/docs/configuration-manual) with a maximum of 200 KLoc per code base.

4. Your repository gets a score in Better Code Hub. The more guidelines you get right, the higher the score. The maximum is 10 out of 10. All guidelines are equally important so please aim for a 10 for new codebases.

5. All the scores are here on this [scoreboard](https://github.com/gameoftrades/gameoftrades-bettercodehub/blob/master/1.%20scoreboard.md)


## How to get started.

1. Make sure that you are a member of [GameofTrades](https://github.com/gameoftrades). Membership of the gameoftrades organization allows you to store and analyse private repo's on GitHub.

2. Visit [bettercodehub.com](https://bettercodehub.com) and accept the scopes, please!

3. Press Play button to get instant feedback on the 10 guidelines, browse the report, pick refactor candidates and turn them into GitHub Issues.

4. Enable Push & Pull Request support by clicking on the PR icon on the card

5. Send your badge code to be added to the scoreboard. [here](https://github.com/gameoftrades/gameoftrades-bettercodehub/blob/master/1.%20scoreboard.md)


## How to get support.

1. Send an email to bettercodehub@sig.eu
