## How does improving Code Quality help me? 

You will spend less time fixing bugs. And have more time to ship new features. In Dutch: [Waarom software van gioede kwaliteit goedkoper is](https://www.computable.nl/artikel/blogs/digital-innovation/6689726/5260614/waarom-software-van-goede-kwaliteit-goedkoper-is)

It is amazing to see how far our industry has come over the past decades. New technologies, frameworks, agile processes - some of which were only recently invented - now define the way we work today. One prominently missing building block in the modern development setup is a standardised way to normatively measure code quality - a SMART 'Definition of Done' shared by all developers. That is what the company SIG wanted to solve.

Based on 15+ years of research and tens of thousands of measurements on IT systems from numerous industries, SIG presents 'Better Code Hubâ€™ (BCH), an online environment that allows anyone to measure how their code compares to 10 rules for future-proof code. These ten rules code are described in SIG's book 'Building Maintainable Software by prof Joost Visser', which was published with O'Reilly Media.

A clean codebase keeps development velocity high and makes it easy for developers to start contributing. Better Code Hub indicates just the right amount of refactoring needed to keep it compliant. Better Code Hub checks your code for compliance against 10 benchmarked software engineering guidelines. It gives immediate feedback on where to focus for quality improvements. 16 modern programming languages are supported.


## Evaluating your code by using Better Code Hub (BCH).

1. Your code will be automatically evaluated and benchmarked against 10 guidelines for building future-proof code. Find a concise reference card of the guidelines [here](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*TS-ZTeI7sQS7dy_AlMqSXQ.png)

2. You can check your code against the guidelines using [Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com), a GitHub integration provided by [Software Improvement Group SIG](https://www.sig.eu/better-code-hub/). Better Code Hub integrates with the GitHub workflow and can easily run in your CI/CD pipeline on all your Pull Requests and Pushes.

3. 17 modern programming languages are [supported](https://bettercodehub.com/docs/configuration-manual) with a maximum of 200 KLoc per code base.

4. Your repository gets a score in Better Code Hub. The more guidelines you get right, the higher the score. The maximum is 10 out of 10. All guidelines are equally important so please aim for a 10 for new codebases.

5. Find your scores inside the GitHub conversation flow at the commits and pull request per branch.

6. Press play in the BetterCodeHub.com interface to run your analysis on master.


## How to get started.

1. Make sure that you are a member of [GameofTrades](https://github.com/gameoftrades). Membership of the gameoftrades organization allows you to store and analyse private repo's on GitHub.

2. Visit [bettercodehub.com](https://bettercodehub.com), login with your GitHub handle and accept the 3 security scopes, please!

3. Press the [Play] button to get the feedback following the 10 guidelines, browse the report, pick refactor candidates and turn them into GitHub Issues to be fixed in the next sprint.

4. Enable Push & Pull Request support by clicking on the PR icon on the card describing your repository, this will make Better Code Hub analyse your commits and pull requests.

5. Send a PR to add your badge code to be added to the scoreboard.md


## How to get support.

1. Send an email to bettercodehub@sig.eu
